Split-screen, competitive, silly two player game I made with my son, just for fun. Code is pretty messy and joyful.

Goal of the game: collect yellow trailers, but also steal them from your opponent.

Art and map by Ian.

## Controls:

* player 1 - arrow keys on keyboard
* player 2 - WASD
* ESC - exit
* G - show friction map (debug helper)

## Features

* Map is read from Tiled format (tmx)
* Sprites are read from Tiled format (tsx)
* Each tile comes with associated sub-tile friction map, constraining vehicle movement. Remember: roads fast rivers slow
* go-tiled module coerced to work just fine, move on, nothing to see
* Everything in one glorious file, with no tests provided!
* Erratic trailer movement for additional fun!!!
