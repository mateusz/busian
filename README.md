Competitive two player game. Collect yellow trailers, but also steal them from your opponent. This is just a toy, and the code is pretty messy.

Windows version can be found in releases. For other targets it's easy to compile yourself ;-)

## Controls:

* player 1 - arrow keys on keyboard
* player 2 - WASD
